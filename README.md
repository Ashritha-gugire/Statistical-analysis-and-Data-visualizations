## Project 1: Education vs Prison Costs and Handgun Homicides in USA

### Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between education funding, prison costs, and handgun homicides across different states in the USA.

### Key Features
- Comparison of education and inmate funding across states
- Analysis of handgun homicide rates in relation to state funding
- Visualization of data using US state maps

### Methodologies
- Data extraction and combination from multiple sources
- Visualization using R (ggplot2, maps, usmap, dplyr, viridis)
- Regional analysis (Northeast, Midwest, Gulf coast, East Coast)

### Key Findings
- Disparity in funding between education and inmate costs
- Correlation between high crime rates and poverty in certain regions
- Regional differences in funding allocation and crime rates

## Project 2: Investigating Relationship Between Socio-Economic Status and Cancer

### Overview
This study examines the impact of socioeconomic status on cancer incidence, diagnosis, survival, mortality, education, and economy across the United States.

### Key Features
- Analysis of socioeconomic factors in relation to cancer statistics
- Utilization of various statistical models and techniques
- Investigation of correlations between health coverage, age, and cancer rates

### Methodologies
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Statistical modeling (Linear Regression, K-fold Cross Validation, Principal Component Analysis)
- Visualization techniques for data exploration

### Key Findings
- Correlation between education levels and cancer diagnosis rates
- Impact of private and public health coverage on cancer outcomes
- Regional variations in cancer rates and socioeconomic factors

### Future Work
- Suggestions for further analysis and improvement of models
- Addressing limitations in current data and methodologies


Both projects demonstrate advanced data analysis skills, focusing on critical social issues and utilizing various statistical and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
