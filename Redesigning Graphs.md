Many individuals across the globe doesn’t receive any education and gets addicted towards committing different crimes. Some of them become victim of that crime by getting shotted or by committing suicide. In United States there are 51 states in which many of them doesn’t receive any stipend from government to study,
but at the same time government spend more amount on an jailer or inmate to feed him, on the same side that jailer might be a student in past who didn’t receive any fund to study there by ended up committing crimes. It has been observed that 68% of inmates who receive fund in jail are victims who didn’t get help from during their studies. 

On the other hand, there are many crimes happening in open public spaces where common people are been shotted to death by these inmates. It has been observed per 1,00,000 population 800 are shot death per quarter in USA, there by that states are still living under poverty. Some states like 
California, Texas, and East Coasts regions are prone to these handgun homicides. However, few states in Midwest of USA are not affected by these deaths but it can be inferred that funds given to these states remains constant over the year, but eventually the inmate fund was linearly rising over the year, there by keeping this region above the line in terms of poverty.
